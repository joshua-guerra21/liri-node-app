LIRI Bot
Overview
In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Before You Begin
LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to your computer.

To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests using the axios package to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.

Submission Guide
Create and use a standard GitHub repository. As this is a CLI App, it cannot be deployed to GitHub pages or Heroku. This time you'll need to include screenshots, a GIF, and/or a video showing us that you have the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots/GIFs or a link to a video in a README.md file.

Include screenshots (or a GIF/Video) of the typical user flow of your application. Make sure to include the use of Spotify, Bands in Town, and OMDB.

Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers/other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.

Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading.
